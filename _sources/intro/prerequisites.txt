|sumtimes|_ has been tested on versions 2.7 and 3.4 of |python|. There are two |python|
dependencies:

*   |dendro|_ :cite:`Dendropy`
*   |pyyaml|_

If you do not have these modules, you will need to install them before you can
use |sumtimes|_. You can do this via the command line::

    $ sudo pip install dendropy
    $ sudo pip install pyyaml

If you do not have admin privileges, or you prefer to install locally, you can
use::

    $ pip install --user dendropy
    $ pip install --user pyyaml
